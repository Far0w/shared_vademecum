Something that means something to me. At the same time, it had to look and sound nice, because it will be the word I place on my synths.</p><p>At first, I found “Levi.” I was inspired by <a href=https://scavengers-reign.fandom.com/wiki/Levi>Levi</a> in Scavengers Reign.</p><p><img src=images/Levi3.jpeg alt=Levi3></p><p>I like sci-fi, and I liked this robot: how it becomes more and more organic throughout the episodes. I realized it actually captured two ideas that resonated with me:</p><ul><li>The relationship between an engineer and his machines</li><li>A machine that becomes more human and organic over time</li></ul><p>For the first point, it’s a bit like the relationship between an artist and their creation. But what I like in the engineer–machine connection is that there’s room for unpredictability. There’s a sense of devotion and even sacrifice that you give to a piece of hardware: something that might seem cold, but grows alive through time and effort.</p><p>The second point reflects a long-term vision for how I want to develop my electronic creations.
I’ll start with something I know: something simple and reassuring. Something I can look at and say: yes, it’s basic, but that’s part of the process.
No pressure to make something overly complex at first. But still, there’s a clear vision, a target, a destination. In the future, I want to make pieces that are less predictable, that can even amaze myself, his creator.</p><p><strong>The “i” at the end of VOXi is a legacy of that.</strong></p><h1 id=i-will-keep-the-mistery-alive-for-the-three-first-letters>I will keep the mistery alive for the three first letters</h1><p>As for VOX, maybe I’ll share why I chose that someday. It’s something much more personal: something “Levi” couldn’t fully capture for me.
It’s pure coincidence that vox means “voice” or “sound” in Latin.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></div><div class=toc><strong>Table of contents:</strong><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></div><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var t,e=document.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,t="shared-vademecum",e.src="//"+t+".disqus.com/embed.js",(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]).appendChild(e)})()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by
