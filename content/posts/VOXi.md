# I searched… 

…for something with personal meaning, something I could.. relate to when I look back on this project.
Something that means something to me. At the same time, it had to look and sound nice, because it will be the word I place on my synths.

At first, I found “Levi.” I was inspired by [Levi](https://scavengers-reign.fandom.com/wiki/Levi) in Scavengers Reign.

I like sci-fi, and I liked this robot: how it becomes more and more organic throughout the episodes. I realized it actually captured two ideas that resonated with me:

- The relationship between an engineer and his machines
- A machine that becomes more human and organic over time

For the first point, it’s a bit like the relationship between an artist and their creation. But what I like in the engineer–machine connection is that there’s room for unpredictability. There’s a sense of devotion and even sacrifice that you give to a piece of hardware: something that might seem cold, but grows alive through time and effort.

The second point reflects a long-term vision for how I want to develop my electronic creations.
I’ll start with something I know: something simple and reassuring. Something I can look at and say: yes, it’s basic, but that’s part of the process.
No pressure to make something overly complex at first. But still, there’s a clear vision, a target, a destination. In the future, I want to make pieces that are less predictable, that can even amaze myself, his creator.

**The “i” at the end of VOXi is a legacy of that.**

# I will keep the mistery alive for the three first letters

As for VOX, maybe I’ll share why I chose that someday. It’s something much more personal: something “Levi” couldn’t fully capture for me.
It’s pure coincidence that vox means “voice” or “sound” in Latin.
